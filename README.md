# 🏆 C Interview Preparation Repository

Welcome to my **C Interview Ladder** practice repo!  
This repository contains topic-wise C programming questions (low → medium → high → company-level) that I am solving to strengthen my fundamentals and prepare for **internships & placements** in my 3rd/4th year.

## 📌 Why this repo?
- To **track my progress** in solving C interview questions.  
- To maintain a **public portfolio** for recruiters.  
- To improve problem-solving skills in **C (low-level language skills are crucial for ML, Systems, and Core CS roles)**.  
- To revisit solutions quickly before interviews.

## 🚀 How I Practice
1. Pick a topic from my **C Interview Ladder PDF**.  
2. Solve the **Low → Medium → High → Company** question for that topic.  
3. Push solution to the repo.  
4. Update the **Progress Tracker** above.

## 🎯 Goals
